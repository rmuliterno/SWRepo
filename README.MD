# SWRepo

## Running the app

  There are no config tweaks, so just install all the dependencies either with yarn or npm and run the start script with:
  `yarn start` or `npm run start`
  
  For tests run the command `yarn test --coverage` or `npm run test --coverage`
  
### Things to add later

  Adding a header and footer on default layout would be nice, also a navigation to a page for displaying a movie's detailed info with a thumbnail and description would be a good idea
